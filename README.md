# .dotfiles

These are the configs for my current work setup.

## Setup

I'm currently using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) to setup the configs, so let's setup nvim as example.

After clonning the project:

```
cd .dotfiles
stow nvim

profit
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add tmux configs
- [ ] Install script
